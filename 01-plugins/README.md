# Comparing Plugins

The first topic is to compare plugins. Although this is just the interface to the AI Code Assistant, the developer experience is heavily influenced by the actual plugins.

Topics to focus on:

- **Chat interface.** Add a short question like `how can I use the code assistant?`. Check the user experience. Clear the text box.
- **Code completion.** Try to write a simple function and see if the code assistant can complete it. What is the performance?
- **Code generation.** While writing in the same code file, what are the integrated options available? Left menu, shortcuts?
- **Plugin configuration.** Can you configure the plugin to your needs? For example, what shortcuts are available? Can I easily disable it temporally?
- **Code Assistant usage.** Can I see how much code I have written with the code assistant? Can I see how much time I have saved?
- **Logging.** Can I see what the code assistant is doing? Can I see what the code assistant is doing in the background?
