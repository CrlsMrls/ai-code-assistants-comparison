# AI Code Assistants Battle

This repository contains the code for comparing AI Code Assistants. 

Each folder includes a different topic to consider when comparing AI Code Assistants. Three of these are small projects on their own using different technologies: Angular for the frontend, Java for the backend, and Python for scripting.  Without the proper scaffold, the code is not realistic and unfair to compare. 

Open the IDE of your choice in each folder and compare the assistants using the following topics:
- [1. Which plugin is the best and more complete?](./01-plugins/README.md)
- [2. StackOverflow vs Code Assistants](./02-searches/README.md)
- [3. Create a UI component using Angular](./03-angular/README.md)
- [4. Fix security issues in a Java-based backend service](./04-java/README.md)
- [5. Create a stock plotter with Python](./05-python/README.md)



Common pair programming scenarios:

- Improve existing code
- Simplify code
- Write test cases
- Make code more efficient
- Debug code
