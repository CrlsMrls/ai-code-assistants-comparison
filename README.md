# AI Code Assistants Battle

This repository contains the code for comparing AI Code Assistants. 

The goal is to compare the AI Code Assistants in the context of a pair programming session. Evaluate the assistants based on the quality of the code suggestions, the speed of the suggestions, and the overall experience.

Each folder includes an area of interest to developers. Three of them are complete (small) projects: Angular for the frontend, Java for the backend, and Python for scripting. Without the completeness of each project, the code may not be realistic and you may miss interesting AI Code Assistant advantages (i.e. include the whole project workspace as the prompt).

Folders:
- [1. Which plugin is the best and more complete?](./01-plugins/README.md)
- [2. StackOverflow vs Code Assistants](./02-searches/README.md)
- [3. Create a UI component using Angular](./03-angular/README.md)
- [4. Fix security issues in a Java-based backend service](./04-java/README.md)
- [5. Create a stock plotter with Python](./05-python/README.md)

Select the IDE of your choice, open each folder separately and compare the assistants.


Common pair programming scenarios:

- Improve existing code
- Simplify code
- Write test cases
- Make code more efficient
- Debug code
