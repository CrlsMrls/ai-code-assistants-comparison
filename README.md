# Code Assistants Battle

This repository contains the code for the Code Assistants Battle project. The project is a competition between different code assistants to see which one is the best at helping developers write code.

The project is split in separate folders, each one containing a different code task. 


## Topics to discuss

1. Which plugin is the best and more complete?
2. StackOverflow vs Code Assistants


### 2. StackOverflow vs Code Assistants

StackOverflow is a platform where developers can ask questions and get answers from other developers. Will code assistants replace StackOverflow in the future?
